#' Add caching with reactivity to an object
#'
#' @description
#'
#' `bindCache()` adds caching to the following kinds of objects used in Shiny:
#'
#' * [reactive()]` expressions. * `render*` functions, like [renderText()],
#' [renderTable()], and so on.
#'
#' Ordinary [reactive()] expressions will cache their most recent value. This
#' can make computation more efficient, because time-consuming code can execute
#' once and the result can be used in multiple different places without needing
#' to re-execute the code.
#'
#' When `bindCache()` is used on a reactive expression, any number of previous
#' values can be cache (as long as they fit in the cache). You must provide one
#' or more expressions that are used to generate a _cache key_. The `...`
#' expressions are put together in a list and hashed, and the result is used as
#' the cache **key**.
#'
#' There is also a **value** expression, which is the expression passed to the
#' original reactive.
#'
#' For each possible **key**, there should be one possible **value** returned by
#' the original reactive expression; a given key should not correspond to
#' multiple possible values from the reactive expression.
#'
#' To use `bindCache()`, the key should be fast to compute, and the value should
#' be slow to compute (so that it benefits from caching).  To determine if the
#' value should be computed, a cached reactive evaluates the key, and then
#' serializes and hashes the result. If the resulting hashed key is in the
#' cache, then the cached reactive simply retrieves the previously calculated
#' value and returns it; if not, then the value is computed and the result is
#' stored in the cache before being returned.
#'
#' In most cases, the key will contain any reactive inputs that are used by the
#' value expression. It is also best to use non-reference objects, since the
#' serialization of these objects may not capture relevant changes.
#'
#' `bindCache()` is often used in conjunction with [bindEvent()].
#'
#'
#' @section Cache keys and reactivity:
#'
#'   Because the **value** expression (from the original [reactive()]) is
#'   cached, it is not necessarily re-executed when someone retrieves a value,
#'   and therefore it can't be used to decide what objects to take reactive
#'   dependencies on. Instead, the **key** is used to figure out which objects
#'   to take reactive dependencies on. In short, the key expression is reactive,
#'   and value expression is no longer reactive.
#'
#'   Here's an example of what not to do: if the key is `input$x` and the value
#'   expression is from `reactive({input$x + input$y})`, then the resulting
#'   cached reactive  will only take a reactive dependency on `input$x` -- it
#'   won't recompute `{input$x + input$y}` when just `input$y` changes.
#'   Moreover, the cache won't use `input$y` as part of the key, and so it could
#'   return incorrect values in the future when it retrieves values from the
#'   cache. (See the examples below for an example of this.)
#'
#'   A better cache key would be something like `input$x, input$y`. This does
#'   two things: it ensures that a reactive dependency is taken on both
#'   `input$x` and `input$y`, and it also makes sure that both values are
#'   represented in the cache key.
#'
#'   In general, `key` should use the same reactive inputs as `value`, but the
#'   computation should be simpler. If there are other (non-reactive) values
#'   that are consumed, such as external data sources, they should be used in
#'   the `key` as well. Note that if the `key` is large, it can make sense to do
#'   some sort of reduction on it so that the serialization and hashing of the
#'   cache key is not too expensive.
#'
#'   Remember that the key is _reactive_, so it is not re-executed every single
#'   time that someone accesses the cached reactive. It is only re-executed if
#'   it has been invalidated by one of the reactives it depends on. For
#'   example, suppose we have this cached reactive:
#'
#'   ```
#'   r <- reactive({ input$x + input$y }) %>%
#'     bindCache(input$x, input$y)
#'   ```
#'
#' In this case, the key expression is essentially `reactive(list(input$x,
#' input$y))` (there's a bit more to it, but that's a good enough
#' approximation). The first time `r()` is called, it executes the key, then
#' fails to find it in the cache, so it executes the value expression, `{
#' input$x + input$y }`. If `r()` is called again, then it does not need to
#' re-execute the key expression, because it has not been invalidated via a
#' change to `input$x` or `input$y`; it simply returns the previous value.
#' However, if `input$x` or `input$y` changes, then the reactive expression will
#' be invalidated, and the next time that someone calls `r()`, the key
#' expression will need to be re-executed.
#'
#' Note that if the cached reactive is passed to [bindEvent()], then the key
#' expression will no longer be reactive; instead, the event expression will be
#' reactive.
#'
#'
#' @section Async with cached reactives:
#'
#'   With a cached reactive expression, the key and/or value expression can be
#'   _asynchronous_. In other words, they can be promises --- not regular R
#'   promises, but rather objects provided by the
#'   \href{https://rstudio.github.io/promises/}{\pkg{promises}}  package, which
#'   are similar to promises in JavaScript. (See [promises::promise()] for more
#'   information.) You can also use [future::future()] objects to run code in a
#'   separate process or even on a remote machine.
#'
#'   If the value returns a promise, then anything that consumes the cached
#'   reactive must expect it to return a promise.
#'
#'   Similarly, if the key is a promise (in other words, if it is asynchronous),
#'   then the entire cached reactive must be asynchronous, since the key must be
#'   computed asynchronously before it knows whether to compute the value or the
#'   value is retrieved from the cache. Anything that consumes the cached
#'   reactive must therefore expect it to return a promise.
#'
#'
#' @section Cache scope:
#'
#'   By default, a cached reactive is scoped to the running application. That
#'   means that it shares a cache with all user sessions connected to the
#'   application (within the R process). This is done with the `cache`
#'   parameter's default value, `"app"`.
#'
#'   With an app-level cache scope, one user can benefit from the work done for
#'   another user's session. In most cases, this is the best way to get
#'   performance improvements from caching. However, in some cases, this could
#'   leak information between sessions. For example, if the cache key does not
#'   fully encompass the inputs used by the value, then data could leak between
#'   the sessions. Or if a user sees that a cached reactive returns its value
#'   very quickly, they may be able to infer that someone else has already used
#'   it with the same values.
#'
#'   It is also possible to scope the cache to the session, with
#'   `cache="session"`. This removes the risk of information leaking between
#'   sessions, but then one session cannot benefit from computations performed in
#'   another session.
#'
#'   It is possible to pass in caching objects directly to
#'   `bindCache()`. This can be useful if, for example, you want to use a
#'   particular type of cache with specific cached reactives, or if you want to
#'   use a [cachem::cache_disk()] that is shared across multiple processes and
#'   persists beyond the current R session.
#'
#'   To use different settings for an application-scoped cache, you can call
#'   [shinyOptions()] at the top of your app.R, server.R, or
#'   global.R. For example, this will create a cache with 500 MB of space
#'   instead of the default 200 MB:
#'
#'   ```
#'   shinyOptions(cache = cachem::cache_mem(size = 500e6))
#'   ```
#'
#'   To use different settings for a session-scoped cache, you can set
#'   `self$cache` at the top of your server function. By default, it will create
#'   a 200 MB memory cache for each session , but you can replace it with
#'   something different. To use the session-scoped cache, you must also call
#'   `bindCache()` with `cache="session"`. This will create a 100 MB cache for
#'   the session:
#'   ```
#'   function(input, output, session) {
#'     session$cache <- cachem::cache_mem(size = 100e6)
#'     ...
#'   }
#'   ```
#'
#'   If you want to use a cache that is shared across multiple R processes, you
#'   can use a [cachem::cache_disk()]. You can create a application-level shared
#'   cache by putting this at the top of your app.R, server.R, or global.R:
#'
#'   ```
#'   shinyOptions(cache = cachem::cache_disk(file.path(dirname(tempdir()), "myapp-cache"))
#'   ```
#'
#'   This will create a subdirectory in your system temp directory named
#'   `myapp-cache` (replace `myapp-cache` with a unique name of
#'   your choosing). On most platforms, this directory will be removed when
#'   your system reboots. This cache will persist across multiple starts and
#'   stops of the R process, as long as you do not reboot.
#'
#'   To have the cache persist even across multiple reboots, you can create the
#'   cache in a location outside of the temp directory. For example, it could
#'   be a subdirectory of the application:
#'
#'   ```
#'   shinyOptions(cache = cachem::cache_disk("./myapp-cache"))
#'   ```
#'   In this case, resetting the cache will have to be done manually, by deleting
#'   the directory.
#'
#'   You can also scope a cache to just one item, or selected items. To do that,
#'   create a [cachem::cache_mem()] or [cachem::cache_disk()], and pass it
#'   as the `cache` argument of `bindCache()`.
#'
#' @section Cache key internals:
#'
#'   The actual cache key that is used internally takes value from evaluating the
#'   key expression(s) and combines it with the (unevaluated) value expression.
#'
#'   This means that if there are two cached reactives which have the same result
#'   from evaluating the key, but different value expressions, then they will not
#'   need to worry about collisions.
#'
#'   However, if two cached reactives have identical key and value expressions
#'   expressions, they will share the cached values. This is useful when using
#'   `cache="app"`: there may be multiple user sessions which create separate
#'   cached reactive objects (because they are created from the same code in the
#'   server function, but the server function is executed once for each user
#'   session), and those cached reactive objects across sessions can share
#'   values in the cache.

#'
#' @section Developing render functions for caching:
#'
#'   If you write `render` functions (for example, `renderFoo()`), you may
#'   need to provide a `cacheHint`, so that `bindCache()` knows how to correctly
#'   cache the output.
#'
#'   The potential problem is a cache collision. Consider the following:
#'
#'   ```
#'   output$x1 <- renderText({ input$x }) %>% bindCache(input$x)
#'   output$x2 <- renderText({ input$x * 2 }) %>% bindCache(input$x)
#'   ```
#'
#'   Both `output$x1` and `output$x2` use `input$x` as part of their cache key,
#'   but if it were the only thing used in the cache key, then the two outputs
#'   would have a cache collision, and they would have the same output. To avoid
#'   this, a _cache hint_ is automatically added when [renderText()] calls
#'   [createRenderFunction()]. The cache hint is used as part of the actual
#'   cache key, in addition to the one passed to `bindCache()` by the user. The
#'   cache hint can be viewed by calling the internal Shiny function
#'   `extractCacheHint()`:
#'
#'   ```
#'   r <- renderText({ input$x })
#'   shiny:::extractCacheHint(r)
#'   ```
#'
#'   This returns a nested list containing an item, `$origUserFunc$body`, which
#'   in this case is the expression which was passed to `renderText()`:
#'   `{ input$x }`. This (quoted)  expression is mixed into the actual cache
#'   key, and it is how `output$x1` does not have collisions with `output$x2`.
#'
#'   For most developers of render functions, nothing extra needs to be done;
#'   the automatic inference of the cache hint is sufficient. Again, you can
#'   check it by calling `shiny:::extractCacheHint()`, and by testing the
#'   render function for cache collisions in a real application.
#'
#'   In some cases, however, the automatic cache hint inference is not
#'   sufficient, and it is necessary to provide a cache hint. This is true
#'   for `renderPrint()`. Unlike `renderText()`, it wraps the user-provided
#'   expression in another function, before passing it to [markRenderFunction()]
#'   (instead of [createRenderFunction()]). Because the user code is wrapped in
#'   another function, markRenderFunction() is not able to automatically extract
#'   the user-provided code and use it in the cache key. Instead, `renderPrint`
#'   calls `markRenderFunction()`, it explicitly passes along a `cacheHint`,
#'   which includes a label and the original user expression.
#'
#' @section Uncacheable objects:
#'
#'   Some render functions cannot be cached, typically because they have side
#'   effects or modify some external state, and they must re-execute each time
#'   in order to work properly.
#'
#'   For developers of such code, they should call [createRenderFunction()] or
#'   [markRenderFunction()] with `cacheHint = FALSE`.
#'
#'
#' @param x The object to add caching to.
#' @param ... One or more expressions to use in the caching key.
#' @param cache The scope of the cache, or a cache object. This can be `"app"`
#'   (the default), `"session"`, or a cache object like a [cachem::cache_disk()].
#'   See the Cache Scoping section for more information.
